# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
*PROPOSED METHOD*
There are several different algorithms and methods for eye tracking, and monitoring. Most of them in some way relate to features of the eye (typically reflections from the eye) within a video image of the driver. The original aim of this project was to use the retinal reflection as a means to finding the eyes on the face, and then using the absence of this reflection as a way of detecting when the eyes are closed. Applying this algorithm on consecutive video frames may aid in the calculation of eye closure period. Eye closure period for drowsy drivers are longer than normal blinking. It is also very little longer time could result in severe crash. So we will warn the driver as soon as closed eye is detected.
